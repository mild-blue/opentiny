# OpenTiny

**The world’s most customizable open-source rich text editor—built for developers by developers.**

OpenTiny is a fork of TinyMCE, a well-established, open-source WYSIWYG editor. We're committed to maintaining and improving this powerful editor while keeping it forever under the MIT License, encouraging innovation and freedom for developers worldwide.

## Why OpenTiny?

We're using the last available MIT version of TinyMCE to build upon the strong foundation it provides, aiming to enhance the project with more flexibility, features, and a commitment to open-source principles. We encourage contributions from the community to help us shape the future of rich text editing on the web.

OpenTiny is designed to be:
- **Lightweight and customizable**: Easily fit it into your project.
- **Scalable and flexible**: Suited for small and large applications alike.
- **Developer-friendly**: Contributions are welcome, and the project is maintained with open-source collaboration in mind.

## Get started with OpenTiny

Getting started with OpenTiny is simple. Whether you're deploying it via the cloud or self-hosting, you'll have a robust, customizable editor running in just a few minutes.

- [TinyMCE Self-hosted Deployment Guide](https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/tinymce/6/npm-projects/)

OpenTiny offers a wide range of configuration options, allowing you to easily integrate it into your application. Begin personalizing the editor with a [basic setup](https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/tinymce/6/basic-setup/) and expand as needed.

## Features

### Integration

OpenTiny is easy to integrate into your projects with the help of various components. We maintain the [opentiny-react](https://github.com/mild-blue/opentiny-react) repository, which can be used as a replacement for [tinymce-react](https://github.com/tinymce/tinymce-react).

Although we don’t actively maintain the other integrations, such as [tinymce-vue](https://github.com/tinymce/tinymce-vue) and [tinymce-angular](https://github.com/tinymce/tinymce-angular), they can be forked and easily adapted for use with OpenTiny.

With over 29 integrations, and 400+ APIs, see the TinyMCE docs for a full list of editor [integrations](https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/tinymce/6/integrations/).

### Customization

It is easy to [configure the UI](https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/tinymce/6/customize-ui/) of your rich text editor to match the design of your site, product or application. Due to its flexibility, you can [configure the editor](https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/tinymce/6/basic-setup/) with as much or as little functionality as you like, depending on your requirements.

With [50+ powerful plugins available](https://www.tiny.cloud/tinymce/features/), and content editable as the basis of TinyMCE, adding additional functionality is as simple as including a single line of code.

Realizing the full power of most plugins requires only a few lines more.

### Extensibility

Sometimes your editor requirements can be quite unique, and you need the freedom and flexibility to innovate. Thanks to TinyMCE being open source, you can view the source code and develop your own extensions for custom functionality to meet your own requirements.

The TinyMCE [API](https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/tinymce/6/apis/tinymce.root/) is exposed to make it easier for you to write custom functionality that fits within the existing framework of TinyMCE [UI components](https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/tinymce/6/custom-ui-components/).
